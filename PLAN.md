# SmartSpreadsheet 2.0 - AI Spreadsheet Autofill Plan

## Overview
A spreadsheet-like web app where the user enters a list of items (e.g., company names) in the first column and a list of attributes (e.g., "Industry", "CEO") in the first row. The AI automatically fills in the rest of the grid with the appropriate values for each (item, attribute) pair.

---

## Phase 1: UI/UX Overhaul ✅ COMPLETED

### 1.1 Spreadsheet Grid UI
- [x] Implement an Excel-like grid (custom or with a grid library)
- [x] First column: Editable cells for user to input items (e.g., company names)
- [x] First row: Editable cells for user to input attributes/column names
- [x] All other cells: Initially empty, to be filled by AI

### 1.2 Input Controls
- [x] Add "Add Row" and "Add Column" buttons
- [x] Allow pasting a list of items for the first column
- [x] Allow pasting a list of attributes for the first row

### 1.3 UX Details
- [x] Highlight cells as they are being processed/filled
- [x] Show loading spinners or progress indicators in cells
- [x] Allow editing of first row/column at any time and re-trigger AI fill

---

## Phase 2: Backend/AI Changes ✅ COMPLETED

### 2.1 API Contract
- [x] Accept a list of row labels (items) and column labels (attributes)
- [x] For each (item, attribute) pair, create an AI job to predict the value

### 2.2 Prompt Engineering
- [x] For each cell, generate a prompt like: "What is the [attribute] of [item]?"

### 2.3 Job Fan-out
- [x] Backend creates a job for every cell (excluding first row/column)
- [x] Results are stored and streamed back to the frontend as they complete

**Implementation Notes:**
- Added new `/api/v1/autofill` endpoint that accepts `{rows, cols}` arrays
- Added new `/api/v1/autofill/:id/status` endpoint for polling results
- Updated worker to process both legacy and autofill jobs from separate Redis streams
- Worker generates prompts like "What is the CEO of Apple?" for each cell
- Results are stored in Redis hash with format `autofill:{id}:results[row:col]`

---

## Phase 3: Real-Time Results ✅ COMPLETED

### 3.1 Frontend Polling/Streaming
- [x] As results come in, update the corresponding cell in the grid
- [x] Show status (loading, error, completed) per cell

### 3.2 Export/Copy
- [x] Allow user to export the filled-in table as CSV/Excel
- [x] Copy-to-clipboard for the whole table

**Implementation Notes:**
- Frontend polls `/api/v1/autofill/:id/status` every 2 seconds
- Results are parsed and displayed in real-time in the grid
- Export functionality creates CSV from the completed grid
- Progress tracking shows completion percentage

---

## Phase 4: Polish & Edge Cases

### 4.1 Validation
- [ ] Prevent empty first row/column
- [ ] Limit max rows/columns for MVP

### 4.2 Error Handling
- [ ] Show errors in cells if AI fails
- [ ] Allow retry for failed cells

### 4.3 Performance
- [ ] Batch requests if needed
- [ ] Show progress bar for large tables

---

## Success Criteria
- [x] User can input a list of items (rows) and attributes (columns)
- [x] AI fills in all relevant cells with correct values
- [x] Real-time updates as cells are filled
- [x] User can export or copy the completed table
- [x] UI is intuitive and feels like a spreadsheet

**✅ ALL SUCCESS CRITERIA MET!**

## Testing Results
- ✅ Backend autofill endpoints working correctly
- ✅ Worker processing jobs and storing results
- ✅ Frontend successfully using new autofill workflow
- ✅ Real-time updates working as cells are filled
- ✅ Export functionality working
- ✅ End-to-end test with Tesla/Microsoft data successful
- ✅ CORS issues resolved for chain-runner service
- ✅ Frontend initialization errors fixed
- ✅ End-to-end test with Netflix/Amazon data successful

## Bug Fixes Applied
### CORS Issue Resolution
- **Problem**: Frontend couldn't access chain-runner health endpoint due to CORS policy
- **Solution**: Added CORS middleware to chain-runner FastAPI app
- **Implementation**: Added `CORSMiddleware` with allowed origins for localhost:3000

### Frontend Initialization Fix
- **Problem**: DOM elements not available when setting up event listeners
- **Solution**: Implemented robust DOM element waiting with timeout
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added `waitForElement()` function that polls for DOM elements with timeout
  - Made `setupEventListeners()` async and wait for all required elements
  - Added 100ms delay in `initializeApp()` for extra safety
  - Proper error handling and logging for missing elements
